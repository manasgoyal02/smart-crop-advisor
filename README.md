# smart-crop-advisor
This project is a smart crop recommendation system built using Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit. It predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The core of the model is a Random Forest Classifier trained on a crop recommendation dataset. Once a crop is predicted, the application visualizes the prediction confidence using a bar chart of probabilities (via Matplotlib). Additionally, the app is integrated with the Google Gemini API (Generative AI) which provides expert advice on how to grow the recommended crop, and also allows users to ask follow-up questions for more personalized insights.
